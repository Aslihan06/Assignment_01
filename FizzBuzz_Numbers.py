Task : Print the Fizz Buzz numbers.

Fizz Buzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation. 

Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:

* if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
* if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
* for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
* print the rest of the numbers unchanged.

Output each value on a separate line.
